PA165 Rental Construction Machinery team evaluation - project: https://github.com/xskerik/RentalConstructionMachinery

a) Checklist evaluation:
-0.5b: DataAccessException handled in DAO layer
-0.5b: Authorship of commits and classes is poorly readable
-0.5b: Poor test coverage of some service layer classes - CustomerService and MachineService

Total points: 8.5 points

b) General Comments:
It seems that all team members are contributing evenly to this team project (except Jakub, which is not working on project, as stated on README file).
According to git blame, Matej has approx. 1900 line of codes (least commits), Tomas 900 loc (most commits), and Zdenek 1500 loc. 
Some @Overrride annotations are missing in service implement classes.
Some Javadoc is missing and mainly @Author annotations are missing in half classes. 
DataAccessException should be handled in service layer, not in dao layer.
All requirements are done.

c) Strong points of project:
Clear code. Only 3 people created this project. All members contributed equaly.

d) Weaknesses of the project:
Test coverage could be improved, specifically service layer classes CustomerService and MachineService - some methods are not covered by test at all.
Authorship of commits are badly readable. E-mails are not used correctly, and commit authors are Zdenek Skerik, Matej Jakimov, tomas and xskerik. 
I would suggest to improve this for milestone 3.
Almost all classes are missing authorship comments. Many of classes that have authorship comments are unreadable, like: Created by jakac.

e) Other notes:
Some classes have unused imports.
Choose a version of your dependencies in pom.xml file. Our submitted project has stopped working because of new released versions of dependencies.

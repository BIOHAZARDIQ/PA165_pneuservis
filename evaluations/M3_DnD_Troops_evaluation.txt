b) General Comments:
This project was finished by only one student.

c) Strong points of project:
This project looks really good, despite of fact that it was finished by only one student.
Responsive UI thanks to usage of bootstrap libraries.

d) Weaknesses of the project:
Most of the classes are missing javadoc (only @author is used).
REST interface is missing.
User interface issues:
- We'd suggest to use dropdown for picking a Role when creating new Hero - e.g. using form:select
- Hero's Role can be changed only to enum RoleName, but in UI we cannot see this enum and thus role names.
- When editing Hero's Role, random name is causing exception. No validation is implemented.
- No confirmation dialog when about to delete an entity
- Unable to logout
- No validation is implemented when updating money for Troop (negative money or string causes exception)
- Adding Hero to Troop when he is already in one Troop causes exception
- Adding Hero to Troop which does not exist causes exception
- Removing Hero from Troop if he is not in any causes exception

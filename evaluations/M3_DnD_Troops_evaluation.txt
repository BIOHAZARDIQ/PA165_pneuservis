d) Weaknesses of the project:
Most of the classes are missing javadoc (only @author is used).
REST interface is missing.
For role user:
- Role of hero can be changed only to enum RoleName, but in UI we cannot see this enum and thus role names. 
Random role name is causing exception. No validation is implemented.

- unable to logout
